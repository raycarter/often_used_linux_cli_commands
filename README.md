Daily often used commands under Linux (Ubuntu)
==============================================

This is a list of my daily often used commands under Ubuntu Linux server and 
desktop. It's for the people like me who do not have a good memory. I hope it 
will save you a lot of time if you have this list near at hand and mostly don't 
need to search a command online anymore. The comments before every command are 
not trying to explain every option in the command. If you have any question 
about the options please see the **--help** or **man** manuals. 

There are a lot of other tricks to use the commands or combinations of the commands. 
If you want to add your often used commands in the list, please **fork** this 
and make **Pull Request**. I'm still trying to update the list if I have some 
time. 

Enjoy the list!

> Fortunately I have the **root** privileges mostly. So the most of the 
following commands don't have a **sudo** prefix.

	### some methods to record output
	# record all output to a file

	command2
	command3
	exit
	# replay the commands (nothing will be re-executed, only the typing and results)
